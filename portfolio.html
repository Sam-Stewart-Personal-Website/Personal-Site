<p class="p4">Summer 2021 turned into a bit of a grind trying to juggle moving 3 times and getting reservations to climb at the park. In the end I just got a bit burnt out and was happy to check out the old but new area Swissco! The rock is immaculate and the landscape is even better I was excited every time I went. Thanks Charle Barron and crew for revitalizing Swissco last year and thanks Chad and Fausey for showing me around this year!</p>

    <p class="p5">One of the first areas I had ever climbed at was Arthurs Rock. I climbed my first v10 there and most of my early moderates, my favorite of which is the Syringe v6 and I would always eye up the terrible holds below thinking that one day I would come back and be able to hang on them. Well finally in March 2021 I got to cleaning and the dream was achieved! Alex Mcintyre, Adlai, and I all went after it and Alex was the one who walked away victorious but soon after I clawed my way up the boulder too!</p>
